## Wally

Wally is a web app which is mobile responsive which can be used to view and download fresh wallpapers. 
Wally was made as a WebHackathon challenge project and this was a great opportunity overall.

The complete build of this website can be found on https://webhackathon-muneebmohd.netlify.app, everyone is very welcome to contribute to this project.

The website was made in under 8 hours of span and yet includes extremely well made and robust features such as Authentication, Custom database and support for several devices, mobile and desktop. It was a solo project and was a fun experience to build!
